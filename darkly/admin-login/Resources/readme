## Step 1:
    We look at if there is a robot.txt file, it is a text file, its placement is at the root of the website. It aims to ban robots of search engines the indexing of certain areas of your website.

## Step 2 : 
On the url '/robots.txt' we find a dir called 'whatever'.

We access it and it turns out a file with username and password.

We use those credentials to login as admin on the url '/admin' to get the flag.

We copy the hash 437394baff5aa33daa618be47b75cb49 from the file downloaded and we use an online hash cracker (CrackStation) to decode it.

So the complete login credentials are:

    Username: root

    Password: qwerty123@

## Prevention:

- Do not store sensitive information (like credentials or hashes) in publicly accessible files such as robots.txt.

- robots.txt is meant for search engine guidance, not security—it can be accessed by anyone.

- Protect sensitive directories using authentication, authorization, or move them outside the web root.

- Use environment variables or secure server-side storage for credentials.
